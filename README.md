# spotify-popularity

This repository holds the code and data used for my final project for DSCI 403 - Introduction to Data Science at Colorado School of Mines.

### Description
The project uses three classification techniques (multinomial logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and a decision tree) to predict popularity of songs given values of features taken from Spotify's Web API.

### Technologies
Python 3.8 and the following packages: lumpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn.

### To Use

The Spotify Web API data is found in *data.csv*. The notebook *preprocessing_and_modeling.ipynb* contains the work we did to clean the data and train/test classification models.
